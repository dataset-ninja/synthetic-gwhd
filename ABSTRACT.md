The **Synthetic GWHD** dataset was made as part of participation for the [Global Wheat Detection Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection). The images were generated through the application of Style Transfer and Pix2Pix techniques. The dataset includes the original images in *corrected_train* split. This dataset could be considered as an augmentation of original GWHD dataset ([available on DatasetNinja](https://datasetninja.com/gwhd))
